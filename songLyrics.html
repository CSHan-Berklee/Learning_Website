<p>Just a small town girl <br>
Livin' in a lonely world <br>
She took the midnight train going anywhere<br>
Just a city boy<br>
Born and raised in South Detroit<br>
He took the midnight train going anywhere<br>
<p></p>
A singer in a smokey room<br>
A smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>
For a smile they can share the night<br>
It goes on and on and on and on</p>

<p></p>
Strangers waitin'<br>
Up and down the boulevard<br>
Their shadows searchin' in the night</p>
<p></p>
Streetlights, people<br>
Livin' just to find emotion<br>
Hidin' somewhere in the night<br>
<p></p>
Workin' hard to get my fill<br>
Everybody wants a thrill<br>
Payin' anything to roll the dice<br>
Just one more time<br>
<p></p>
Some'll win, some will lose<br>
Some are born to sing the blues<br>
Whoa, the movie never ends<br>
It goes on and on and on and on<br>

Strangers waitin'<br>
Up and down the boulevard<br>
Their shadows searchin' in the night<br>
<p></p>
Streetlights, people<br>
Livin' just to find emotion<br>
Hidin', somewhere in the night<br>
<p></p>
Don't stop believin'<br>
Hold on to that feelin'<br>
Streetlights, people<br>
<p></p>
Don't stop believin'<br>
Hold on<br>
Streetlights, people<br>
<p></p>
Don't stop believin'<br>
Hold on to that feelin'<br>
Streetlights, people</p>
